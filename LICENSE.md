# Applicable licenses in this project and dependencies of this project

## Novell NDK

Copyright owned by whomever owns Novell nowadays (OpenText, I believe). Dockerfile pulls it in from the Internet Archive.

Although Novell only ever offered the NDK behind a registration wall, none of the original download sites are on-line anymore as of April 2025. The only site where I could find a copy was the Internet Archive. When building the dev container for this project, the Dockerfile pulls the ISO from there.

## nlm-kit and nlm-samples

See `COPYING.LIB` file that comes with nlm-kit and the `COPYING` file that comes with nlm-samples.
